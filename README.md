# RapidoJS

A simple, lightweight javascript librairie crafted for performance to made your page loading a breeze.

It stores your Script, Css & Generic data in LocalStorage to load them rapidly in the next refresh

## Installation

Include script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):

    <script src="/path/to/Rapido.js"></script>

**Do not include the script directly from GitHub. ** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked
in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.
