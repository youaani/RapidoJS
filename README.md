# RapidoJS

A simple, lightweight javascript librairie aimed to be the only script in your <HEAD>, crafted for performance to made your web app loading a breeze.

RapidoJS simply stores your script, css & data files in LocalStorage to load them rapidly in the next page refresh or API call.

## Installation

Include script in your <HEAD>:

    <script src="/path/to/Rapido.js"></script>

**Do not include the script directly from GitHub. ** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked
in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.
